## Deployment

1. **Create the Database: [ahorcado](https://github.com/punchulo/PY/blob/main/ahorcado.sql).**
2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies.**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Configure MySQL Connection and Encryption Key in the Code.**
    ```python
    import mysql.connector
    from hashlib import sha256

    # MySQL Connection
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host=" ",  # MySQL Host (usually localhost)
        user=" ",  # MySQL User
        password=" ",  # MySQL Password
        database="ahorcado",
    )

    # Encryption Key (Replace with a secure key)
    encryption_key = "your_secure_key"
    ```

4. **Run the .py file.**

## Additional Notes

Beyond the core functionality, the project encompasses the following features:

- **Password Encryption:** Leverages the "hashlib" library to encrypt user passwords. Passwords undergo hashing using "sha256" from the hashlib module, ensuring secure storage in the database.

- **Database Structure:** Adopts a simple yet effective database structure, with minimal tables focused on essential information for the game. This maintains an efficient and purpose-specific database.

- **Game Features:** Encompasses various aspects such as user account creation, login, account deletion, random word selection, letter guessing, and the Hangman game itself. This provides a holistic and immersive gaming experience.

- **Python Modules:** Harnesses diverse Python modules and libraries, including hashlib for encryption, random for word generation, and mysql.connector for MySQL database connection and manipulation.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Leaderboard:** Implement a dynamic leaderboard to track and showcase the highest-scoring players.

2. **GUI Enhancement:** Develop an intuitive graphical user interface to elevate the overall gaming experience.
