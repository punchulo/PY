# Python (connection with MySQL)


"Hangman/Ahorcado" with Python and the connection to a MySQL database, in addition to the implementation of password encryption.

By combining these elements, the creation of a "Hangman/ahorcado" game with Python that connects to a MySQL database is achieved, ensuring the security of passwords through encryption before storage. This comprehensive approach offers an interactive and secure gaming experience for users, while ensuring the integrity of the data stored in the database.

## Deployment

Create the database [ahorcado](https://github.com/punchulo/PY/blob/main/ahorcado_usuarios.sql).

-In the code, you place the necessary information for it to connect."
```bash
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
    host=" ", --> Host de MySQL(Suele ser localhost)
    user=" ", --> Usuario de MySQL
    password=" ", --> ContraseÃ±a de MySQL
    database="ahorcado",
)
```
-Run the .py file.

## Additional Notes

In addition to the core functionality, the project includes the following aspects:
- Password Encryption: The project uses the "hashlib" library to encrypt user passwords. When entering a password to create an account, a hash of it is generated using "sha256" from the hashlib module, ensuring the security of the passwords stored in the database.

- Database Structure: The database used in the project has a simple structure, with only a few tables receiving the minimal information necessary for the game. This contributes to maintaining a focused and efficient database for the specific purpose of the "Hangman/Ahorcado" game.

- Game Features: The "Hangman/Ahorcado" game implements several key features, such as user account creation, login, account deletion, selection of random words, letter guessing, and the hangman game itself. These features provide a complete experience for users, from creating accounts to interacting with the game itself.

- Python Modules: The project makes use of various Python modules and libraries, such as hashlib for encryption, random for random word generation, and mysql.connector for connection and manipulation of the MySQL database.
